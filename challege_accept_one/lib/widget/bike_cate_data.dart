        'Ladakh can be the dream bike riding destination in India. Blessed with such mesmerizing beauty this region of Jammu & Kashmir state is a challenge that any crazy-adventurous bike rider would like to take. The trail being rugged, the weather being rough and unpredictable and cherry on top the continuous risk of landslides and other hazards keep the riders on their toes. Ladakh is the land of beautiful lakes, high mountain passes, Buddhist monasteries and meandering roads that are mostly unpaved. Therefore while planning a ride here, one is spoilt for choices but what you must know that you can never make a bad choice as each trail has its perks and thrills.',

Waterfalls, terraced paddy fields, alpine forests, mountain streams, small human settlements, now covered roads (in winter) and the opportunity to witness unique tribal culture makes this high altitude route an irresistible one  for an adventurist',
